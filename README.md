# About
1. React - Is a Library, not a framework. So we can use React in our existing apps whereever we need, no need to create an entire app from scratch using React.
2. Every thing is a react element (object).
3. Everything is rendered only inside the root element (which we decide). When render is called, React Element gets converted to HTML
4. React Create Element -> needs 3 inputs -> html tag to be created, attributes, children of this element -> attributes and children together called as *PROPS*.
