# About
1. React - Is a Library, not a framework. So we can use React in our existing apps whereever we need, no need to create an entire app from scratch using React.
2. Every thing is a react element (object).
3. Everything is rendered only inside the root element (which we decide). When render is called, React Element gets converted to HTML
4. create element needs 3 inputs -> tag, attributes, children -> attributes and children together called as props.
